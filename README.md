# docker-mockups

Each subfolder labeled with the technology example. Each section can be combined into one docker-compose to mockup a system. 

The intention for this is to work with my training courses, mockup up ideas, test software, workaround for approval processes. 

## How to use:
Each section has a README.md for the specific technology. You can also make a combination. 

To combine technologies merge the folder into one then combine the docker-compose.yml.

## Example:
### Combine MySql with MinIO:
merge both the mysql and minio directories.
